					<li>What is the data set? </li> <i>Registered Marital Status by Age by Sex.</i> The data describes the location of different age groups and genders and their marital status from a list of never married, married, separated, divorced and widowed. <br> <br>


					<li>Why is it collected? </li> This data can help describe people's living arrangements, family formation and the social well-being of our society. The data also describes family dissolution for couples and children which is important for social program development and research. Furthermore, it becomes evident that this data shows the overall distribution of different demographics in Sydney with a strong correlation to the latte line, housing prices and locations of interest (inner Sydney).
					<br> <br>
					<li>Which government department would use this data? </li> <i>The Department of Social Services, the Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development, the Department of Education.</i> These departments deal with the infrastructure necessary to different groups of people, their required facilities and services. For example, providing public transportation and facilities such as schools to areas with a high proportion of families and social services to dissolved families. <br> <br>

					<li>What private sectors would use it? </li>
					<i>Services for families, elderly care, businesses aimed at young people without children.</i> These services can use this data to find the locations where they are most necessary. For example, there is a higher proportion of young families in Sydney's West and businesses catering to young singles (eg. cafes, bars, restaurants) have a bigger market closer to the city. <br> <br>

					<li>How does the data set change the way you think about space? </li>
					The location of different groups of people depends largely on family status, subsequent financial situation and access to desired facilities. <br> <br>

					<li>How does it change across Sydney? </li>
					Observations from the data reveal: 
					<ul> 
					<li>Single people are concentrated closer to the inner city and married people of the same age are further away. </li>
					<li>Younger married couples (25-34) are more concentrated in Sydney's South-West and West due to housing affordability. </li> 
					<li>Middle aged married couples (45-54) are more evenly distributed with a higher proportion in the North Shore. </li>
					<li>Elderly singles are at the fringes of Sydney and more concentrated in Sydney's North. </li></ul> <br> 

					<li>Does it relate to the latte line? </li>
					Yes, the data does relate to the latte line as young married couples (possibly with children) occupy more affordable housing South of the latte line. Middle-aged married couples are more evenly distributed throughout Sydney with a higher proportion in the North Shore as they get older. This is due to Sydney's housing prices, which force younger couples with less income to Sydney's South West. Older married couples are more financially established and able to purchase housing in Sydney's North or have purchased houses before housing prices in Sydney significantly increased.  <br><br>

					<li>How has the data set changed over time?  </li>
					The trend for younger couples to move to Sydney's far South West and West significantly increased between 2011 and 2016. Other places where the concentration of young married couples increased correlate with recently developed high density housing areas such as Homebush, Mascot and Macquarie. The dataset is unlikely to change in the near future due to current housing price trends and the tendency for married couples to want to purchase property. <br><br>

					<li>How is it significant to people's lives? </li>
					This data reveals the underlying distribution of different groups of people in Sydney. Younger, unmarried people are located nearer the city, young couples who want more space are located further West and more affluent middle aged couples are located further North. There are also a number of old aged care facilities on the outskirts of the city.<br><br>

					<li>Would it be good to keep it the same? </li>
					This data shows an underlying inequality in Sydney's urban distribution. This is an inevitable trend in a large city but there needs to be care taken so that residents have equal access to facilities. Jobs, schools, businesses and elderly care need to be appropriately distributed. <br> <br>

					<li>If you were to change it, how?</li>
					Create affordable housing nearer the city, promote multiple city hubs (eg. Parramatta) to provide jobs for people living further from the CBD, improve family related facilities  such as schools below the latte line, change policies that allow the elderly to move into more appropriate housing (smaller houses, easily accessible facilities).
