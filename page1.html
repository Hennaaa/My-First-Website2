		<p> <br> The above animations describe demographic trends related to marital status in Sydney. They illustrate the tendency for unmarried people to be located close to the city, for younger couples to be located in Sydney's South-West and older couples in Sydney's North. These trends are influenced by single people's desire to be close to the city and "trendy" areas and housing prices that stop young couples from being able to afford property in certain parts of Sydney.

		<h2>Sydney Housing Prices </h2>
		<p> The following graphic shows the location of million dollar house sales in 2015. Expensive areas correlate to where single people rent and older couples can afford houses (inner city, Sydney's North and East).  </p> <br><br>

		<h2>Hip Suburbs </h2>
		<p> The image below shows Sydney's "hippest" suburbs as quantified by Microburbs, a suburb analysis website. It combines a range of data sources to determine area trendiness including proportion of single people working in creative roles or studying in university, ethnic diversity, commutability and cultural destinations such as top rating restaurants, cafes, pubs, art galleries, body modification studios and yoga centres. It highlights the inner city as the trendiest area in Sydney, which correlates with the preferred location of unmarried people of all age groups. </p>
